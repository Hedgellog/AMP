## Acknowledgement

We sincerely acknowledge the following works for their valuable contributions and inspiration to this project:

- **SparseFormer: A Credible Dual-CNN Expert-Guided Transformer for Remote Sensing Image Segmentation With Sparse Point Annotation (TGRS 2025)** — for providing the implementation of the multi-branch pseudo-label generation strategy.(https://github.com/Yujia73/SparseFormer)

- **Sparsely Annotated Semantic Segmentation with Adaptive Gaussian Mixtures** — for providing the foundational network structure implementation.(https://github.com/Luffy03/AGMM-SASS)

- **DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision** — for providing the pretrained visual feature backbone used in this work.(https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2)

We deeply appreciate the authors of these works for making their research and code publicly available to the community.
